/**
 * Problem Statement:
 * Given a playlist of songs, you have to design a song shuffler.
 * This song shuffler is not like the normal song shuffler that shuffles the complete playlist at the start and returns a shuffled list, but instead when asked for a next song to be played, returns a random song from the list of songs.
 * The next random song to be played should satisfy a condition that the song was not played in the last 'k' turns.
 * You have to make sure, that at each call, all the eligible (not played during last k turns) songs have equal probability of being played next.
 *
 * For example:
 * if songs = [A, B, C, D], k = 2
